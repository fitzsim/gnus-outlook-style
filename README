This package implements Outlook-style quoting for Gnus and mu4e

There is a significant number of people who wants to use Emacs
for managing their email but work in organsisations that are using
Outlook. One major feature (or, misfeature perhaps) is the way
Outlook handles quoting. It includes the entire email chain at the
bottom of the mail, with the reply on top. Users of Outlook also
expects this chain to preserve all HTML formatting as well as any
inlined images.

This package allows Emacs users to participate in such threads. It
allows the user to write markup which is processed by Muse, and the
content is then inserted into the existing HTML, resulting in emails
blends perfectly into an Outlook thread.

Most of the work is performed by an external program written in
Common Lisp. Building this program is the most complicated part
of setting up this package. The section below will explain who
to do this.
